How To Use My App:

First off you're going to need to make a database with the use of my 
init.sql script file. How I did this was through XAMPP Control Panel.
I opened up the shell terminal and logged in using my credentials (mysql -u root -p password:"")
Once logged in, I ran the command: "source init.sql" which then created my database, tables, and 
inserted values into said tables. 

How my app works:

Once you have completed the above step you are ready to login and register. 
There is an input bar with a header above that reads "Type your name in to sign in or 
register and then press ENTER:" follow these directions and put in your name to register within the database.
If youre name is already on the list then it will just log you in and youre name will be highlighted in red. 

If you wish to delete yourself or anyone else from the database, there is an input bar with a header above that reads:
"Type a name in to delete a user and then press "Enter":". Once done the user name you typed in will dissapear
from the table and all of its information will be deleted. 

Now for the fun part: ranking anime characters.

If you wish to upvote an anime character that you like, just type the name of the said character in
the input box with the header that reads: "Type the anime character that you wish to increase their 
ranking and hit ENTER:" and you will increase that characters rating by one. To help you decide which
anime character to vote for, there are pictures of said anime characters and a link to 
information about each of them.
